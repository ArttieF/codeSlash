# Synopsis

This started as a personal project to help with learning python. Now I'm mostly working on tGame and it's functionality as a library. I'm trying to keep it to things that are text related and used frequently. I may rename it at some pointor extend the name. For now thogh as I find functions needed in working on codeSlash i will add them to tGame.

# TGame
Is a utility library focused on text based RPG utils, and a few extras functions that I find used often. [here](https://github.com/ArttieF/tGame)

# codeSlash
Just a little text based RPG I'm working with for fun [here](https://github.com/ArttieF/codeSlash).
