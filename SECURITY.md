## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project / game has [tGame](https://github.com/ArttieF/tGame) 
integrated into it, both are personal attempts to learn python in
my down time and are in very early alpha. As such open an issue
if you locate any potential issues of any kind and please be very
descriptive. Alternatively if it is a major security issue you may
email ArttieF+GitHub@gmail.com
